# Sentence-Embeddings-Using-N-Gram-Features-and-Contrastive-Learning-for-Multilingual-Datasets

This project explores a novel approach to generating sentence embeddings by leveraging **N-gram features** combined with **contrastive learning**. It aims to improve semantic representation across **multilingual datasets**, especially for low-resource languages.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Sentence embeddings using character and word N-grams  
- Contrastive learning framework to align similar sentences  
- Works across multilingual and domain-diverse datasets  
- Evaluation using cosine similarity and clustering visualization

---

## 📁 Datasets Used

- `Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.txt` – Fictional narrative
- `bible.txt` – Multilingual structured text
- `Dataset25.txt` – Custom multilingual dataset
